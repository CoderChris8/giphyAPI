						  <h3>1. Obtain an access key through GIPHY API.</h3>
						  <h3>2. Switch protocol in the query URL from http to https.</h3>
						  <h3>3. Have a high-level understanding of how this assignment works before attempting to code.</h3> 
						  <ul>
						  	<li><h4>Create an array of strings with a related topic for each on that interests you. Chose video games as a theme.</h4></li>
						  	<li><h4>Take the topics in the array and create buttons in the HTML and use loops that appends a button for each string in the array.</h4></li>
